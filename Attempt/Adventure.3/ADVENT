# ADVENT : Colossal cave adventure
# MS-MAKE 4.07, MSC 5.1 Makefile
# 4 May 1991
#
# This file was modified slightly so it creates a FAMILY
# mode program that can run under both OS/2 and MS-DOS
# This was done by adding the -Fb option to the cl command.  
# You also need to have DOSCALLS.LIB and API.LIB in your current directory.  
# and the OS/2 MAKE, LINK, CL, and BIND programs in your path.

# I did not write this program, I only converted it to a family application
# It appears to work, but if you have problems, take out the -Fb option,
# and re-compile it as a strictly OS/2 application
