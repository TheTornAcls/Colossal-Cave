		Notes on ADVENTURE  (for IBM PC)


    1)  TO PLAY ADVENTURE
	The ADVENTURE game requires one single sided drive & 96K of
	memory.  The system file "CONFIG.SYS"  <MUST>  contain the
	the two statements, "BUFFERS=10" and "FILES=10".  The following
	files  MUST  reside on the default drive:

	ADVENT.EXE, ADVENT1.TXT, ADVENT2.TXT, ADVENT3.TXT, ADVENT4.TXT


	The game may be started by typing       "ADVENT<cr>".
	A saved game may be restarted by typing "ADVENT -r<cr>".
	Debug data will be output by typing     "ADVENT -d -d -d<cr>".


    2)  TO HACK ADVENTURE
	The ADVENTURE game source files are either, header, code or
	text files.

	ADVENT	.C	- initialization, save game, restore game
	ENGLISH	.C	- interpret game player's commands
	DATABASE.C	- text file management & output
	ITVERB	.C	- intransitive verbs execution
	VERB	.C	-   transitive verbs execution
	TURN	.C	- analysis & execution of player's command

	ADVENT0	.C	- utility to create "ADVTEXT.H" file
	ADVENT1	.TXT	- long  cave description
	ADVENT2	.TXT	- short cave description
	ADVENT3	.TXT	- long & short object description
	ADVENT4	.TXT	- conversational descriptions & responses
	ADVENT	.DOC	- this ADVENTURE documentation file

	STDIO	.H	- standard i/o header
	ADVENT	.H	- #define & structure statements
	ADVWORD	.H	- words & codes array
	ADVCAVE	.H	- cave & travel arrays
	ADVTEXT	.H	- TXT file message indexes
	ADVDEF	.H	- data constants & variables definitions
	ADVDEC	.H	- data constants & variables declarations

	WARNING:
	The TXT files are the ASCII text messages used throughout the
	game.  They may be modified ONLY if you have the utility
	program, "ADVENT0.EXE" or the source "ADVENT0.C".  This program
	creates the header file "ADVTEXT.H" which is "#include"d into
	"ADVENT.C" during compilation.  After ANY changes to the "TXT"
	files, recreate a new "ADVTEXT.H" file.  Make sure that the
	four "TXT" files and the utility "ADVENT0.EXE" are on the
	default drive, then type "ADVENT0<cr>".


	The game was translated from BDS C to CII C86 and standardized
	as per UNIX standard i/o library functions.  The following
	changes were instituted:

	0) UNIX standard i/o
	1) "include"d header files & "extern"al statements added
	2) cave/travel  data arrays are now internal
	3) word/code    data arrays are now internal
	4) TXT message index arrays are now internal
	5) TXT file format doesn't require # terminator character
	6) save & restore game overlays intergrated with "ADVENT.C"
	7) word/code syntax parsing optimized in "ENGLISH.C"
	   BINARY LEX-ORDERED WORD LOOK-UP added in "DATABASE.C"
	8) TXT message indexing & output optimized in "DATABASE.C"
	9) TXT message typos corrected
	A) created "ADVENT0.C" utility (cf. #1, #4 & #5)
	B) created "ADVENT.DOC" documentation file


	Compile with CII C OPTIMIZING C86 version 2.10+, via:
	(See CCADV.BAT)

		CC1 filename
		CC2 filename -u
		CC3 filename
		CC4 filename

	Link with the standard PC-DOS linker, via:
	(See CLADV.BAT)

	A>B:
	B>A:LINK ADVENT,ENGLISH,DATABASE,ITVERB,VERB,TURN,,CON/MAP,A:C86S2S


	The modifications described above were implemented by:
