Hi There!...


I remember when I first tried adventure. My early excitement
soon turned to discouragement when I realized that I was going
nowhere fast.

The following steps should help you get started. There is a
dashed line a little ways down. You might want to try it on
your own at that point, otherwise I'll give you a hand through
your first major trial (the snake)...



Here goes...

(notes in parens are just comments, do not enter them)
(enter a carriage return -- the little twisty arrow -- at the end of
 each line )

advent

y                       (get the instructions)

get keys

get lamp

get food

get bottle

inventory               (use this anytime to see what you have)

look                    (use this anytime to see where you are)

w                       (west to get out of building)

follow stream

d                       (down)

s                       (south)

unlock grate

enter

light lamp


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    at this point you might want to try it on your own
    and see how you do. You can always come back and continue
    on with the help.

   see, that wasn't so hard... It only took me a month to get this far
   but once the snake is out of the way you can explore forever...

Watch out for dwarves, the axe is very valuable on them

The passages all alike work better if you have things to drop

You can say "score" at any time to see how you are doing
and say "save" to preserve your current position

Have fun, and happy adventuring!  For many folks,
this game is reason enough to have a computer.
